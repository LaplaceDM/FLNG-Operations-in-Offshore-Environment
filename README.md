National University of Singapore (May to July 2023)
Projects completed: Developed an interactive digital twin system to simulate an ocean vessel (FLNG) with real-time marine data, achieving controllability of the simulated vessel's motion, and voice-controlled navigation.
                    Skills learned: Used the Unity3D game engine to create the digital twin simulation.
Role: Research Assistant for Professor Shuzhi Sam Ge (Director of Controls and Simulation Lab, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the National University of Singapore).
Tasks: Integrated real-time weather data into Unity3D, enabling dynamic updates of marine environment parameters such as weather conditions. Implemented PID control algorithms to achieve controllability of the simulated vesselâ€™s motion.              Introduced a voice-interaction allowing the vessel to recognize voice commands for navigation.
